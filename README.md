# DownloadMangaInBatch

English | [简体中文](https://blog.kukmoon.com/74aefe92/)

Download every page of a manga in batch and then save all pages as a zip package with PowerShell. No third-party software or apps needed! (Maybe you have to install something like an VPN when you are blocked from visiting the server)

## Usage

1. Use it as a command in PowerShell or Windows Terminal Window:

```
DownloadMangaInBatch.ps1 [<The URI of the last page of the manga, e.g. https://hnt.javmobile.mobi/000/022/22751/34.jpg>]
```

2. Double click `DownloadMangaInBatch.ps1`, and type or past the URI of the last page of the manga.


The script will parse the structure of the URI and download every page in batch.
